    <h2>Sport 🤾🏼‍♀️</h2>
    <p><center>
 	 I've done sport all my life, starting with tennis, which I played for 7 years, then gymnastics, athletics and finally handball, which I've been playing for 7 years now.</center>

	<h2>Travel 🏕️</h2>
  <p>
 	 I've travelled a lot since I was a child, visiting countries like Egypt in particular, where I was able to discover a new culture and above all the history of one of the greatest civilisations the Earth has ever known.

    <h2>Hobby 😎</h2>
    <p>
 	 Ever since I was a little girl, I've always enjoyed spending time with the people I love, like my friends and family. This can be as much about wandering around Paris as simply sitting on a sofa and watching a film together.
